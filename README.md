# python-basics
I have been learning syntax and python programming through basic tasks from the University of Helsinki
Introduction to Programming course and am now moving on to Advanced Programming. 
You will find here exercises which can be run by themselves, for example a sudoku solver. This repository
is here for learning purposes, but you are welcome to look at and run the code. It has all been tested to work.
